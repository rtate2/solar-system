## Description
Use this application to learn facts about the eight planets within the solar system. When the user moves their mouse over a planet card the name will disappear and the image of the planet will appear.

When the user clicks on a planet card all the cards disappear and the only thing displayed on the page is information about the planet they clicked on.

When the user clicks on the 'X' on the single planet card, that information goes away and all the original cards are displayed again.

When the user types in the search bar, planet cards will only show up if they have what is typed in their name or description.
